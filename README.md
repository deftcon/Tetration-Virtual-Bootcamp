# Cisco Tetration - Hands On Lab

## Student/Learner Lab Guide

Firstly, if you are here for the Lab Guide, it is co-hosted here under the `/labguide/` folder in the repo using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), currently with a [Jekyll theme](https://jekyllrb.com/) called 'Slate', and can be found here: [Lab Guide Documentation](https://onstakinc.github.io/cisco-tetration-hol/labguide/).

## Lab Environment Deployment and Git Repo Usage

This lab environment deploys entirely to AWS with the current unique exception of Cisco ISE, which requires deployment to an on-prem vCenter environment with a VPN connection and route table addition. 


#### Files Required to Deploy to AWS

Deployment of the environment for lab pod(s) requires the use of three files - namely: `parameters.yml`, `cisco-hol-pod-cft-template.yml`, and `launch.py`. 


`launch.py` reads in the parameters unique to each deployment set from `parameters.yml`, then executes one entire deployment of `cisco-hol-pod-cft-template.yml` per number of `student_count` found in `parameters.yml`. Student count begins with `00` and thus we recommend designating the first pod for the lab admin/instructor as a pristene deployment for use in demoing or troubleshooting any issues an actual student might for some reason encounter, and allowing the first student to be the second pod, which would begin with the numbering `01`. 


#### Parameters File Example

Below is an example of a `parameters.yml` file, however with additional inline commented markup, which can also be found in the directory `parameters-templates` under the name `parameters-example.yml`. The inline comments should be fairly self-explanatory, although much will be parsed out and explained following the example file.

```

#### Requirements / Dependancies

`launch.py` requires Python 3.7 as well as the boto3 and pyyaml packages which can be installed by executing the following commands:

`pip install boto3`  
`pip install pyyaml`

It is important to note that prior to running `launch.py`, you must have a few things already created in your AWS environment - namely a VPC, an IGW, and a S3 bucket.
1. VPC: This probably goes without saying, but we recommend a non-default VPC. Place your VPC ID in `parameters.yml` in the `vpc_id:` line (no quotes surounding the value). This VPC must have at least two CIDR blocks, one for `subnet_range_primary` and one for `subnet_range_secondary`. It is important that **no** subnets be created in this VPC whatsoever, else the script will error out. `launch.py` will create the subnets and we have a brief discussion about them below. 
2. IGW: You must have one IGW created in your `vpc_id` and designated in the `parameters.yml` in the `internet_gateway_id:` lin (no quotes surounding the value).
3. S3 Bucket: Due to the size of the CFT, AWS requires that we first upload it to an S3 bucket prior to calling it and executing against it. It is required that you have already created the empty S3 bucket and placed the name of the bucket in the `parameters.yml` in the `s3_bucket:` line (no quotes surounding the value).
4. Two (2) Elastic IPs per student pod. These must be already *allocated* to your region, but not yet *assigned* to any ENIs. This requirement exists due to AWS not allowing a Public IP to be assigned to any EC2 instance with more than a single ENI. There are currently three instances that have multiple ENIs, including Guacamole, Tet Data Ingest, and ASAv. Guac requires one so that students can access the environment from the public internet, and Tet Data Ingest requires the ability to communicate out to the internet to reach the TaaS cluster. ASAv only communicates internally, even if you have ISE running on-prem, assuming you have a VGW back to your CGW. If you need ASAv to speak externally, there is some code that can be uncommented in the `cisco-hol-pod-cft-template.yml` file. 

> NOTE: By default, [AWS limits you to five (5) Elastic IPs per region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/vpc-service.html#w571aab9d325b7b3b5){:target="_blank"}. If you plan to deploy more than two (2) student pods, you will need to [submit a request for service quota increase](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home?#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=vpc){:target="_blank"}. 


#### Subnets

A quick discussion on subnets to be created at launch time is in order. This VPC must have at least two CIDR blocks, one for `subnet_range_primary` and one for `subnet_range_secondary`.


The `subnet_range_primary` and `subnet_range_secondary` field both require that you give them /16 address space. This is due to the fact that for every student pod to be created, the third octet will be used to indicate the student index #. 

Also due to AWS strict requirement that there be at least two subnets available in order to spin up an EKS cluster, there will be two subnets created in `subnet_range_primary` per student - one will begin at the base and the other will be calculated to begin much higher, so that each subnet's third octet should (for the most part) follow the student numbering index value. 

Say you chose `10.0.0.0/16` as your primary range, and `198.18.0.0/16` as your secondary. You could expect to see three subnets generated, only the first two of which would ever be populated with any workloads. 

##### Examples:

**_Student 1_**
* 10.0.1.0/24    < "Internal / Corporate" workload subnet (Inside ASAv)
* 198.18.1.0/24  < "External / Internet" workload subnet (Outside ASAv)
* 10.0.128.0/24  < not used, simply required by AWS

**_Student 2_**
* 10.0.2.0/24    < "Internal / Corporate" workload subnet (Inside ASAv)
* 198.18.2.0/24  < "External / Internet" workload subnet (Outside ASAv)
* 10.0.129.0/24  < not used, simply required by AWS


> Note that the default subnet value for the secondary range is `198.18.0.0/16` and was chosen specifically becuase it both represented a "real internet, non-RFC1918 IP range", and also that it falls in the *'Reserved'* range, specifically that "This block has been allocated for use in benchmark tests of network interconnect devices" per [RFC5735](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5735). It could initially be argued that a range such as `198.51.100.0/24` or `203.0.113.0/24` would seem more appropos as they were created so that "This block is assigned as "TEST-NET-2/3" for use in documentation and example code", but they weren't large enough (/24), so the decision was made soundly to provide a real-world-like environment whilst simultaneously avoiding any blackholing any legitimate internet traffic from within the lab environment. 

Here is a diagram that will help to explain the subnets described above in a bit better visual detail:

#### IAM Role API Credentials - Scope and Permissions

The AWS API Access key and Secret key used to deploy is preferred to be stored in the local OS environment variables, vs in the `parameters.yml` file, and the same is mentioned at the top of that file in the comments. The en environment variables should be labeled as `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, respectively. If this is necessary to change, these variable names must be updated in the `launch.py` script to match your local env var names. 

The AWS credentials used need to have permissions that allow them to create, update, and delete the following:

(AWS global)
* S3 bucket (for vpc flow logs)
* IAM role (for EKS)
* IAM User and API Keys with RO access to EC2 & ELB (for student external orchestrators) (this still needs tightening and S3 flow log access)

(Region specific)
* CloudFormation
* Lambda
* CloudWatch
* Eventbridge
* EKS Cluster / EKS Node Groups

(VPC specific)
* Route Tables
* Subnets
* Security Groups
* EC2 (including autoscaling)
* ELB

#### Deploying Lab Environment to AWS

Assuming you've filled out your desired values in `parameters.yml`, it's time to deploy. Change directory to the `cisco-tetration-hol` directory and run python to launch (the below assumes `python` aliases to `python3` or `python3.7`).

```bash
cd /<relative-path>/cisco-tetration-hol
python launch.py
```
> Note that you will be asked to verify most of the data in parameters before proceeding. Enter "Y" (case insensitive) to proceed. Anything other than y/Y will terminate the launch. 

Assuming everything is correct creds allow you should have output similar to the following:

Then you should find in your relative-path `reports` directory, a CSV file with every students' information. An enhancement to export a single XLS file with nicely formatted info *per student* is something we aim to do, in addition to the currently exported single CSV which is still very useful for the Lab Admin. 

#### Tearing Down Lab Environment

Teardown is simple. **_Ensure your `parameters.yml` file is the environment you want to teardown, and ...:_**

```shell
python rollback.py
```

> Note that you will be asked to verify most of the data in parameters before proceeding. Notice that on rollback we require a bit more stringent checking. This is for your protection. You will be asked to enter 'Y' initially and this is case sensitive, then a second verification is performed ensuring your intent, and this one requires you to type out 'YES' initially and this is case sensitive. Anything else will terminate the destruction of the environment. 

Assuming everything is correct creds allow you should have output similar to the following:


```bash

#### Limitations

Currently deploying this lab environment only supports a single 'deployment set' per region, where 'deployment set' is defined as any numerical value defined in `parameters.yml` under the `student_count` field. It essentially is the number of student pods you are deploying at any one time. You must have 2x EIPs per student allocated to your region, as per the above section labeled "Requirements / Dependancies". Removing the single deployment option per region is an enhancement that we aim to add shortly. 

Currently there is a limitation that prevents any abilitiy to increment student pod count once deployed. Since it would take a bit of an effort to add, it is something we will be looking at however, don't aim to add anytime soon.
